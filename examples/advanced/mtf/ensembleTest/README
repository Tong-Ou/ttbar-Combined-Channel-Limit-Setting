Description:
------------

This is the multi-channel model-dependent limit setting code based on BAT. 
Currently the codes are set to reproduce limit setting results in 
https://cds.cern.ch/record/2305138/. 
Channels: R0(R3) medium 1b(2b), tight 1b(2b), 8 in total
Zprime mass points: {1750,2000,2250,2500,2750,3000,4000}

  README             - this file
  ensembleTest.C     - the source code of the main program
  CreateHistograms.C - a macro which create the templates and the pseudodata histograms



Running the code:
--------------------

1. Make sure that BAT is correctly installed in the system.

2. Create the templates and data histograms by calling the ROOT
   macro 'root CreateHistogram_ttbar.C', which reads out the data, 
   signal and background histograms for each channel each mass point.

3. Run the 'acceptance.C' to calculate acceptance*efficiency for each channel
   and each mass point.

4. Run the ensembleTest_ttbar_singlechannel.C to calculate 95% CL upper limit
   with data from a single channel (for example: R0 medium 1b).

5. For multi-channel combination, run the ensembleTest_ttbar.C. Notice that there
   is only one "signal" process, the maximum number of signal events is estimated
   by calculation of likelihood function. The efficiency of each signal template 
   in each channel is decided by the results from Step 3. 
   (There can be single or multiple background processes, depending on the requirements.)

6. After running the ensembleTest_ttbar.C for each mass point, the myLimitSetting.C
   (myLimitSetting_combined.C for multi-channel limit setting)
   can be run to calculate the expected upper limit and uncertainty bands.
